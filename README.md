This is my own portfolio, where I showcase my skills and experiences. It mades with React-Three-Fiber.

Divided in 3 parts including 2 main : "Projects" and "About me". I hope the immersive visualization of my website is will bring the expected charm. I modelized all models in the scene except the jellyfish (that I animated) so thank you to : by LingthyManThatExists (https://skfb.ly/oC9GZ) for the free model !
The website is made for recent search engines (so not for Internet Explorer ahah) and for computers or phones but these must be turned horizontally.

In ExternalScript, there is a webscrapping script to write faster JSON file (project.json).

If you detect any bug contact me.
